# üó°Ô∏è 2D RPG Game ‚Äì OOP Semester Project (May 2025)

A top-down 2D role-playing game (RPG) developed in Unity with C# as part of our Object-Oriented Programming course. This project demonstrates key OOP principles through engaging gameplay involving exploration, combat, and item collection.

## üéÆ Game Overview

* **Explore** a hand-crafted pixel world.
* **Battle** various enemy types with unique behaviors.
* **Collect** coins, potions, and power-ups.
* **Survive** using health and stamina systems.
* **Customize** your experience with multiple weapons (sword, bow, magic).

## ‚ú® Features

* 2-directional player movement with dash ability
* Enemies with AI states (roam, attack, cooldown)
* Destructible environment (bushes, barrels, etc)
* Weapon system (sword, bow & magic laser)
* Cooldown and switching mechanics
* Health & Stamina UI
* Custom cursor
* Drop/pickup system (coins, hearts, stamina globes)
* Multiple enemy types (ghosts, bullet-attackers, grape enemy)
* Scene transitions and 2D lighting
* Player death and respawn logic

## üß† Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

* **Encapsulation**: Each game object manages its own state and logic.
* **Inheritance**: Enemy types extend from a base `Enemy` class.
* **Polymorphism**: Game handles enemies and items using shared interfaces or base classes.
* **Abstraction**: Modular design of combat, health, and item systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

* **Language**: C#
* **Engine**: Unity
* **IDE**: Visual Studio
* **Version Control**: Git
